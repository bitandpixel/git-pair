// State is the effective lifecycle state of a changeset, always derived from
// commit history rather than stored.
//
// There is no state for a completed changeset. Completion archives the review
// history at a head (`git pair change complete`), and the changeset is finished
// when that archived history is merged into the deployment branch by ordinary
// git. git-pair derives state from a changeset's own commits, so it does not
// derive the merge: the archive ref is reported by `status`, not folded into
// the state name.
